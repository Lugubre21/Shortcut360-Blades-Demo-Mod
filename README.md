Shortcut360 - Blades/Demo Mod is a modified version of the original Shortcut360 tool.

‚ú® What‚Äôs new

Full compatibility with the Blades dashboard

Proper support for both GoD and XEX formats

Automatically generates functional shortcuts under the correct folder structure

Preserves original icons and titles where possible

No modification required to your console‚Äôs dashboard files

üß© About the Mod

The original Shortcut360 was designed for NXE and later dashboards, which natively supported GoD containers.
This mod adapts and extends that functionality, bridging the gap so even the nostalgic Blades UI can display and launch your custom or retail game shortcuts.

‚öôÔ∏è How it works

Select a folder to scan for GoD or XEX titles

Provide the directory where the game is installed on your console, for example:
Content\0000000000000000\GameID\00007000\ContainerCode

The tool generates the shortcut and required content structure

Upload the folder to your Xbox 360 via FTP or content manager

Enjoy seeing your game appear on the Blades dashboard

üí° Pro Tip

If you‚Äôre also using Iso2GoD, make sure your conversion output follows this structure:

\TitleID\00007000\Content of the game


When placing the converted game into the Windows directory:

Content\0000000000000000


you only need to remove everything before the ‚ÄúContent‚Äù folder in the path when creating your shortcut in Shortcut360.
This ensures that the generated shortcut points to the correct directory and appears properly on the Blades dashboard.
